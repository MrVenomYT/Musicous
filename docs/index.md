## ✨Latest Updates
Discord.js v13 will break this bot so do not use this with it. We have been started working on [v5](https://github.com/MrVenomYT/Musicous/tree/v5) which will be out in some days/months with new features and much more are on the way.

## 🚧 Prerequisites 

- [Node.js 14+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [discord.js@12.5.3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js/v/12.5.3)
- [Lavalink Server](https://lavalink.darrennathanael.com/SSL/lavalink-with-ssl/)

> NOTE: Lavalink is needed for music functionality. You need to have a working Lavalink server to make the bot work.

## 💨 Run the projects

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/MrVenomYT/Musicous)](https://repl.it/github/MrVenomYT/Musicous)
> Note: If you are hosting your bot in heroku, Please consider upgrading your dyno for running dashboard & bot simultaneously because in free dyno it'll run out of memory(as there are two workers). If you want to run only the bot, turn off the `web` dyno.
